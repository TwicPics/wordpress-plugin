**Create a TwicPics account**

If you don't have any TwicPics account yet, you can create one on [TwicPics website](https://account.twicpics.com/signup) for free.

Once your account is created, TwicPics provides you with a `domain` that has the following syntax `my-sub.twic.pics` , with `my-sub` corresponding to  you personal subdomain.

Your TwicPics domain will allow the plugin to handle image optimization on your WordPress website.

**Connect your TwicPics domain to your WordPress website**

On your TwicPics back-office, from `Domains` section, connect your TwicPics account to your WordPress website.
