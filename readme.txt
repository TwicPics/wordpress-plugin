Instead, an optimized, perfectly sized, device-adapted image is delivered from a location close to him through a worldwide CDN.

== Installation ==

*Follow these steps to help you get started with TwicPics image optimization on your WordPress website.*

**Create a TwicPics account**

If you don't have any TwicPics account yet, you can create one on [TwicPics website](https://account.twicpics.com/signup) for free.

Once your account is created, TwicPics provides you with a `domain` that has the following syntax `subdomain.twic.pics` , with `subdomain` corresponding to  you personal subdomain.

It will allow the plugin to handle your image optimization on WordPress.

**Connect your TwicPics domain to your WordPress website**

*This step will be automatically handled for you in the future versions of the plugin.*

On your TwicPics back-office, from `Domains` section, connect your TwicPics account to your WordPress website.

To do so, click on the button `Add new path`.

A new window opens, in which you must set the URL of your WordPress website as a `path` of your TwicPics domain, as well as the `Source URL` of you WordPress website images.

Say your TwicPics domain is `https://my-sub.twic.pics/` and the URL of your WordPress website is `https://my-wordpress.com/`, then the path `https://my-sub.twic.pics/https://my-wordpress.com/` will point to your WordPress website `https://my-wordpress.com/`, as the source of your images.

Once the configuration of your TwicPics account is done, install the plugin like you would do for any other plugin on WordPress.
