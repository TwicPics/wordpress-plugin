= What is TwicPics? =

Websites are heavier than ever and the main culprits are images. They eat up network bandwidth and increase the time visitors spend waiting for pages to load. Because every passing tenth of a second reduces your website's overall conversion rate, **this dramatically impacts its reputation as well as revenue**.

TwicPics is a Responsive Image Service Solution (SaaS). It offers **on-demand responsive image generation** combined with a **smart and unobtrusive** **JavaScript library**, all based around a **URL-based API**.

TwicPics' library being the heart of this WordPress plugin means **you don't have anything to do regarding your images optimization**. The end-user never sees the original image. Instead, an optimized, perfectly sized, device-adapted image is delivered from a location close to him through a worldwide CDN.
